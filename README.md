# Cycle-React

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pH200/cycle-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pH200/cycle-react)

An [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) functional interface
to [Facebook's React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

Cycle-React allows users to write [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
applications in functional style and represents their UIs as Observables.
In addition, Cycle-React is immutable and uses
[PureRenderMixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html)
internally by default.

Additionally, Cycle-React is also a React-style implementation of a beautiful
framework called [Cycle.js](https://github.com/staltz/cycle).

## Installing

```
npm install cycle-react
```

## Example

```js
let Cycle = require('cycle-react');
let React = require('react');

function computer(interactions) {
  return interactions.get('OnNameChanged')
    .map(ev => ev.target.value)
    .startWith('')
    .map(name =>
      <div>
        <label>Name:</label>
        <input type="text" onChange={interactions.listener('OnNameChanged')} />
        <hr />
        <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
}

Cycle.applyToDOM('.js-container', computer);
```

The input of the `computer` is `interactions`, a collection containing all
user interaction events happening on the user-defined event handlers on the DOM,
which you can query using `interactions.get(eventName)`. And the event handler
can be defined by `interactions.listener(eventName)`.

The output of the `computer` is `Observable<ReactElement>`
(a reactive sequence of elements, in other words, view).

Function `applyToDOM` subscribes that Observable of elements and renders the
elements to DOM, by using `React.createClass` and `React.render` internally.

Notice that although `React.createClass` is mentioned here, you don't have to
use it. That's why Cycle-React was made. We took functions over classes
and mutable states.

You can learn more about the concept behind `applyToDOM` and `Cycle` from
AndrÃ©'s amazing presentation:
["What if the user was a function?"](https://youtu.be/1zj7M1LnJV4)

## React component example

```js
let Cycle = require('cycle-react');
let React = require('react');
let Rx = Cycle.Rx;

// "component" returns a native React component which can be used normally
// by "React.createElement" and "Cycle.applyToDOM".
let Counter = Cycle.component('Counter', function (interactions, props) {
  return props.get('counter').map(counter =>
    <h3>Seconds Elapsed: {counter}</h3>
  );
});

let Timer = Cycle.component('Timer', function () {
  return Rx.Observable.interval(1000).map(i =>
    <Counter counter={i} />
  );
});

Cycle.applyToDOM('.js-container', Timer);
// or
// React.render(
//   React.createElement(Timer),
//   document.querySelector('.js-container'));
```

## Learn more

Cycle-React is a React-style implementation of Cycle.js, so we have the same
concept of handling user interactions. More information of this concept can be
found at: https://github.com/staltz/cycle

## Cycle.js Driver

Starting from
[Cycle.js v0.23](https://github.com/staltz/cycle/releases/tag/v0.23.0),
the driver architecture has been introduced.
Cycle-React provides a DOM driver(powered by React, of course) for Cycle.js.

Details can be found at
["Using Cycle-React's DOM driver for Cycle.js"](/docs/cycle-js-driver.md).

## FAQ

### Can I use Cycle-React with [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)?

Yes. And no extra configuration needed.

[Example](https://github.com/cycle-react-examples/react-hot-boilerplate)

### Can I use Cycle-React with other React components and libraries?

Yes. You can even use Cycle-React with your current React apps. Because
`component` creates the native React component for you.

Examples for integrating Cycle-React with other libraries are work in progress.

Meanwhile, See ["Working with React"](/docs/working-with-react.md)
for guidelines.

## Build standalone JS and the library file for examples

```
npm run dist
```
